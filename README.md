The object of this game is to click on the different crystals to add unknown amounts to you total score to try to reach your current goal.

To start a new game, click on the &quot;Start a New Round&quot; button.  Your randomly selected current goal will be displayed on the screen.

Each of the four crystals on the screen have a different randomly selected value.  The value for each crystal changes every round.  

Click on the crystals to add their value to your total score.  Pay attention to how much your score increases to learn the value of each crystal.

Continue to click on the crystals adding points to your total until your total score matches the current goal.  When your total equals the goal, you win!  But if your total goes over the goal, you lose.

Click on the &quot;Start a New Round&quot; button again to begin again.  The screen also displays your total number of wins and losses.

Good luck!!
